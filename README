# How to setup CloudLab

Prepare a file `cl_manifest.xml` with the manifest of the network from the CloudLab experiment, then run the following command to generate the configuration file.
```
python3 cl_config.py
```
If needed, setup the ssh connections among the cluster nodes:
```
python3 setup_ssh.py
```
Then, install the needed libraries on all nodes and clone the repository on the first node:
```
./setup.sh
```
After setup is complete, connect through `ssh` to the first node and open the `TRAM` folder. You are now ready to build and run the experiments.


# Install dependendencies

libRamCastV3 is a Maven project, therefore you should have Java and Maven installed first.

There is but one dependency: libsense. The libsense library has library netwrapper in turn as dependency. First we install the libraries on the local maven cache, then we compile libRamCastV3.

- netwrapper: git clone https://bitbucket.org/kdubezerra/netwrapper.git
mvn install

- libsense: git clone https://bitbucket.org/kdubezerra/sense.git
mvn install

- libRamCastV3: git clone https://github.com/longle255/libRamcastV3.git
mvn clean install -DskipTests
